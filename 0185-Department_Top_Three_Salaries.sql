 *
 * Table: Employee
 * +--------------+---------+
 * | Column Name  | Type    |
 * +--------------+---------+
 * | id           | int     |
 * | name         | varchar |
 * | salary       | int     |
 * | departmentId | int     |
 * +--------------+---------+
 * id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
 * departmentId  is a foreign key (reference column) of the ID from the
 * Department table.
 * Each row of this table indicates the ID, name, and salary of an employee. It
 * also contains the ID of their department.
 *
 * Table: Department
 * +-------------+---------+
 * | Column Name | Type    |

 * | name        | varchar |
 * +-------------+---------+
 * id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
 * Each row of this table indicates the ID of a department and its name.
 *
 * A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in
 * each of the company's departments. A high earner in a department is an
 * employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that
 * department.
 *
 * Write a solution to find the employees who are high earners in each of the
 * departments.
 *
 * Return the result table in any order.
 *

 * We use `DENSE RANK` and `PARTITION BY` to pick out the employees with the
 * highest salaries in each department.
